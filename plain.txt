I am finally starting to understand why cybersecurity is referred to as both a science and an art! I like that the concepts we have covered are the application of sophisticated mathmatical logic in such an elegant and genius way. As computing power continues to evolve, the techniques have needed to add layers to effectively obfuscate payloads and their ciphers.
For example, early classical ciphers like Caesar cipher exemplifies the "art" of encryption, where a simple concept was at one time effective enough to maintain the confidentiality of ancient roman military intelligence. Fast forward to modern symmetrcial ciphers like AES that are a balanced mix of art and scientific thinking that have raised the bar on encryptions impervious to attacks from adversaries.
