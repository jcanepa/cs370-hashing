Sorry for the late response,
	I find it interesting that probably the biggest problem that occurs in security is social engineering. I personally don't have any professional cybersecurity experience, but I often listen to those with such experience on YouTube. 
	One example of social engineering is using small talk to learn someone's habits. There exists tools that can capture the RFID signals on ID’s and by using social engineering you can determine things such as where someone likes to eat, hang out, and and otherwise be outside of a company. People would frame questions like “Hey, I just moved into {area around company}, do you know any good restaurants nearby”, trying to pry for answers like “Yeah, I go to {this_place} often with colleagues”. After gaining this knowledge they can stake out for when employees from the company go there, attend as a guest while scanning their badge IDs which they can use to get into a locked building.
	I choose social engineering since no matter how secure you build your system, the weakest part of the chain is probably the end users. They will save their passwords onto an unencrypted text file and some spyware will find it out. That is not to say that we should not be using the most secure software. If the only way to break in feasibly is to get the attacker to be there in person, then that can increase their risk, and the costs associated with the attack.
