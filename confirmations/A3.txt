I used to not understand much about cybersecurity and so was never interested in it-- It seemed much more obscure than normal coding and that was difficult enough. But learning about all the algorithms and math behind it, I've really come to enjoy it; especially the recent bits we learned about the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The fact that we can (through algorithms!) generate keys that are public and accessible and yet send confidential messages through them only decipherable by the recipient is amazing. It's like having a P.O box that delivers the mail at your door in a vault instead of in the mailbox. With the constant increase in computing power and miners, I do wonder how systems that rely on hashing and digital signatures (like cryptocurrencies) will fare in the future. On one hand, they may become the new form of widespread currency because of how difficult it is to steal and how easy it can be stored and transferred. This could cause a major upheaval in banking systems. On the other hand, it may turn into a losing race against improving computing powers, considering the frequency new secure models are discovered.
